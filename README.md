This Python script collects session monitoring data on a computer, creating a "sessions" folder and generating log files in the "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_ComputerName.log" format. It logs process start and stop events using the psutil library, allowing for continuous monitoring in an infinite loop, effectively tracking computer activity.
